the use of unofficial platforms for current interactions and transactions, we are driven to provide a dedicated space

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

Fitness Tracker and Trainer (e.g., myfitnesspal)
The Fitness Tracker and Trainer project aims to develop a database system for fitness enthusiasts and professional trainers. This system will store user profiles containing personal information, fitness goals, and past achievements. It will also include a repository for workout
routines, nutrition plans, and progress tracking. Users will have the flexibility to log their daily exercises, monitor nutritional intake, and receive personalized recommendations based on their goals. Professional trainers can utilize the system to create customized workout plans
for their clients, monitor their progress, and provide real-time feedback. The admin user will overview and create reports. The database should efficiently handle user data, exercise logs, nutritional information, and ensure secure access to sensitive health-related data.
